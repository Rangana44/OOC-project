Do the following tasks

1) List down the requirements you have identified, for the system you need to implement.
2) Do a Noun Verb analysis and identify classes in your description.
3) Draw CRC cards for the classes you have identified. You can further refine your classes by
analyzing the requirements further.

Exercise 1:
Draw the class diagram for the classes you have identified in your scenario. You need to use
proper UML notations to draw the class diagram. Show the necessary relationships among classes
using UML notations.Include the attributes and the methods in the classes.
Special Note : Each member should do part of the design which they can code separately. The
final report should indicate the class diagram of the whole system as well as the individual
contribution.

Exercise 2:
Write the coding for the classes in your class diagram. You can write the coding of the class and
the constructors. You need not implement the methods. Write a main program to create the
objects of the classes you have written

Description of the requirements, the classes you identified and the CRC cards. ( no need to add
the Noun Verb analysis to the report)
